============
Installation
============


Using Anaconda or Miniconda (recommended)
-----------------------------------------

Using conda_ (latest version recommended), {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} is installed as follows:


1. Create virtual environment for {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} (optional but recommended):

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ conda create -c conda-forge --name {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} python=3
    $ conda activate {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}


2. Then clone the {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} source code and install {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} and all dependencies from the environment_{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.yml file:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone {{ giturl }}
    $ cd {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
    $ conda env update -n {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} -f tests/CI_docker/context/environment_{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.yml
    $ pip install .


This is the preferred method to install {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}, as it always installs the most recent stable release and
automatically resolves all the dependencies.


Using pip (not recommended)
---------------------------

It is also possible to instal {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} via `pip`_. However, please note that {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} depends on some
open source packages that may cause problems when installed with pip. Therefore, we strongly recommend
to resolve the following dependencies before the pip installer is run:

    * TODO


Then, the pip installer can be run by:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install {{ giturl }}

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.



.. note::

    {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} has been tested with Python 3.6+., i.e., should be fully compatible to all Python versions from 3.6 onwards.
