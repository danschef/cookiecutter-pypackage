============
Installation
============


Using Mamba (recommended)
-------------------------

Using mamba_ (latest version recommended), {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} is installed as follows:


1. Clone the {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} source code and install {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} and all dependencies from the environment_{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.yml file:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone {{ giturl }}
    $ cd {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}


2. Create virtual environment for {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} (optional but recommended):

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ mamba env create -f tests/CI_docker/context/environment_{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.yml
    $ mamba activate {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
    $ pip install .


This is the preferred method to install {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}, as it always installs the most recent stable release and
automatically resolves all the dependencies.


Using Anaconda or Miniconda
---------------------------

Using conda_ (latest version recommended), {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} is installed as follows:


1. Then clone the {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} source code and install {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} and all dependencies from the environment_{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.yml file:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone {{ giturl }}
    $ cd {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}


1. Create virtual environment for {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} (optional but recommended):

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ conda env create -f tests/CI_docker/context/environment_{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.yml
    $ conda activate {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
    $ pip install .



Using pip (not recommended)
---------------------------

It is also possible to instal {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} via `pip`_. However, please note that {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} depends on some
open source packages that may cause problems when installed with pip. Therefore, we strongly recommend
to resolve the following dependencies before the pip installer is run:

    * TODO


Then, the pip installer can be run by:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install {{ giturl }}

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.



.. note::

    {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} has been tested with Python 3.6+., i.e., should be fully compatible to all Python versions from 3.6 onwards.
